# Welcome to the STREET Lab

STREET (**S**ocio-**T**echnical **R**esistanc**E** and **E**thical **T**echnologies) Lab is an interdisciplinary research collective at the [Faculty of Information](http://ischool.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto, and housed at the [Knowledge Media Design Institute (KMDI)](https://kmdi.utoronto.ca/). The lab is focused on understanding and supporting the sociotechnical practices of marginalized communities around the world, with an emphasis on resistance, informality, and social justice. (see [Research](research))

Our research is influenced by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technologies & Development (ICTD), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Social Computing, Development Studies, Political Science, Feminist and Queer theories, Postcolonial Studies, and Critical Theory.

Our work is funded by NSERC, SSHRC, UofT's School of Cities, SDGs@UofT, among others.

 **We currently do not have any research assistant positions at the Lab but are open to Masters Thesis or incoming PhD students** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies)
