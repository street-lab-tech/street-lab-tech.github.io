STREET Lab is an interdisciplinary research collective at the [Faculty of Information](http://ischool.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto, and housed at the [Knowledge Media Design Institute (KMDI)](https://kmdi.utoronto.ca/). The lab is focused on understanding and supporting the sociotechnical practices of marginalized communities around the world, with an emphasis in resistance, informality, and social justice. (see [Research](research))

Our research is influenced by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Social Computing, Development Studies, Political Science, Feminist and Queer theories, Postcolonial Studies, and Critical Theory.
