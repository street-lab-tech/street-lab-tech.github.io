  <h2>Summary</h2>

This project investigates how workers in the digital labour economy are experimenting with and imagining alternatives to corporate digital labour platforms through the framework of digital solidarity economies. We focus in particular on the role of the state in addressing structural inequities and their intersections with digital solidarity initiatives, drawing on insights from the South Asian context. Our ongoing study examines the Lunch Bell project—a state-supported, women-centred meal delivery platform in Kerala, India—which exemplifies a digital solidarity economy by promoting sustainability and tackling gender inequalities through an inclusive labour model.
