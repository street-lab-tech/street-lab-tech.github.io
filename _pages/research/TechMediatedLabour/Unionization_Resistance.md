  <h2>Summary</h2>
The project aims to analyze and document workers' workplace resistance and unionization practices in digital labour platforms in India, develop context-appropriate resistance strategies for technology-mediated labour and re-design algorithmic technologies to support precarious workers.

  <h3>Description</h3>
The emergence of digital labour platforms (DLPs) is transforming labouring experiences worldwide. While these platforms offer flexibility and convenience regarding work time and workspace, they also contribute to workers' insecurity and vulnerability due to the misrecognition of labour and opaque algorithms that manage their work conditions (algorithmic management). This project examines how algorithmic management shapes and affects workers on digital labour platforms in India (e.g. cab drivers, delivery workers, and providers of beauty and home services), documenting their experiences of negotiating algorithmic management and their efforts to resist precarious employment conditions through collective organising, including everyday resistance practices, the formation of worker communities, and unionism. Through qualitative research methods (ethnography, participant observation, in-depth interviews and focused group discussion), we aim to develop context-appropriate resistance strategies for technology-mediated labour and re-design algorithmic technologies to create fairer and more equitable labour practices of incorporating principles of labour justice, transparency and worker participation. Our research sites include West Bengal, New Delhi, Bengaluru, and Trivandrum in India.
