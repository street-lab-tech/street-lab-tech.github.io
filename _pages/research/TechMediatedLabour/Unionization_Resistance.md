  <h2>Summary</h2>
The project aims to analyze and document workers' workplace resistance and unionization practices in digital labour platforms in Canada and India, develop context-appropriate resistance strategies for technology-mediated labour and re-design algorithmic technologies to support precarious workers.

  <h3>Description</h3>
The emergence of digital labour platforms (DLPs) is transforming labouring experiences worldwide. While these platforms offer flexibility and convenience regarding work time and workspace, they also contribute to workers' insecurity and vulnerability due to the misrecognition of labour and opaque algorithms that manage their work conditions (algorithmic management). This project primarily evaluates how algorithmic management shapes and impacts the workers in digital labour platforms (e.g. Cab riders, delivery workers and beauty and home services) in India and Canada. Further, we document the workers' experiences negotiating algorithmic management in DLPs and their efforts to resist precarious employment conditions through collective organizing, which involves everyday resistance practices, the formation of worker communities and unionism. Through qualitative research methods (ethnography, participant observation, in-depth interviews and focused group discussion), we aim to develop context-appropriate resistance strategies for technology-mediated labour and re-design algorithmic technologies to create fairer and more equitable labour practices of incorporating principles of fairness, transparency and worker participation. Our research sites include New Delhi, West Bengal, Mumbai and Kerala in India, Malta and Toronto in Canada.
