  <h3>Summary</h3>
This project examines the ways that the concept of 'care' has expanded and shifted in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
  
  <h3>Description</h3>
Research on care within HCI is expanding beyond traditional human-to-human relationships between caregivers and care recipients. This field now explores how care involves technologies and extends to more-than-human and posthuman entities. Such broadening acknowledges the intricate, interconnected networks through which care unfolds and is experienced across different scales. In this project, we examine the different ways that care is being conceptualized in the HCI field, and are looking at ways that more just, intersectional, and feminist agendas can be enacted through expanding care theories.
