  <h3>Summary</h3>
This project looks at the ways that technologies are being used by reproductive health organizations to ensure people can exercise their human right to reproductive autonomy. This includes the right to have a child, the right not to have a child, and the right to raise children in a safe and healthful environment (Ross, 2017).
  
  <h3>Description</h3>
Access to reproductive health care is at a critical moment, at the intersection of technology, politics, and socioeconomic shifts. In the face of rapid changes, reproductive health organizations are using technologies in novel ways to coordinate access. In this project, we examine the ways that abortion access organizations are using technologies to coordinate access for people seeking care. 
To understand the relational role of technologies with reproductive health, we are focusing on the Midwest United States as the aftermath of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision, which overturned national protections for abortion care. We are taking a reproductive justice (Ross, 2017), ethics of care (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2018; Tronto, 2005), and feminist technoscience lens.
